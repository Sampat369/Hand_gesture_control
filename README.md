# Hand_gesture_control
I developed a hand gesture-based controller using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, enabling real-time interaction with games and applications without touching a keyboard or mouse.  The system uses MediaPipe hand landmarks to detect gestures such as fist, palm, and finger pointing, which are then mapped to specific actions in the game.
